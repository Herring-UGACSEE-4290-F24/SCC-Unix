- Add reset control
    * Should reset the Registers and Special Registers to 0
    * Set all of Data Memory to 0

- Implement HALT
    * Either stop the clock from influencing the SCC
        ~ Use an AND gate on the input for Clock pins.
    * Or just interrupt the PC from updating
        ~ Remember that things are prefetched, so make sure
          that you don't start to continuously repeat a random
          instruction.

- Testbench the Program Counter and using Branch instructions
    * Test the IF and ID versions of the branching

- Also testbench everything else ig

- Implement Load and Store
    * Just interacting with the data memory

- General fixes
    * Fix up the variable names to be more meaningful
    * Make sure that important control lines (if not all of them)
      are being set low when unused
    * Comment all of the code

- Instruction Memory
    * Use a .mem file and interact with a program
        ~ do whatever else that needs
        ~ (may need a full Instruction Memory module to load?)

- Fix the CPSR functionality
    ~ Check logic previous discussed on monday
    ~ should be bangin

- Maybe make the ALU take 33 bit inputs
